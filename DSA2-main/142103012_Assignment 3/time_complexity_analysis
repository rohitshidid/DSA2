Time complexity for the function init_tree() can be determined as folows ->
The worst case complexity would be when the string has even number of
characters.
Every time the string divides into two equal parts, i.e. n/2.
n/2*n/2^2*n/2^3...... = k
Therefore the time complexity for the recursion would be log n with base 2.
Also the while loop would run for n times in the worst case every time
recursion tasks place
Hence the overall complexity fo rthe function would be O(n*logn)

Time complexity for Compute() function would be ->
Let n be the height of the tree. The time taken in the worst case would be n,
as every node cannot have operator on both sides, and has a leaf node on either
side.
The time taken for evaluating will be constant and will be called n number of
times.
Hence, the overall complexity of the functon would be O(n).

Time Complexity for inorder traversal will be ->
Worst case complexity for inorder traversal would be O(n), where n is the
number of nodes in the tree.
Traversal involves reaching out to every node of the tree, hence the time
complexity for any traversal would be O(n).
